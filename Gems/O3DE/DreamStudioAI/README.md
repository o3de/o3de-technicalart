# o3de_dreamstudio

A light integration of Stable Diffusion (AI art generation) into an Open 3D Engine Python Gem, by using the Python API for DreamStudio.AI This Gem will create a dream, by sending a prompt to the server, and retrieving the result as an image stored in an asset folder, where they can be used as textures in materials, or for uses such as a digital matte painting backdrop.

# To Get Started:

1. Install O3DE, or clone and build the engine from source.
2. Use the O3DE project manager, and create a Project (or use an existing one)
3. Configure Gems for your project, add the DreamStudioAI Gem to your project
4. Build your project then start the Editor.exe

Before use, you will also need to set to use dreamstudio.ai

1. Go to the service and make an account: https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream

2. Get your API key: https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/membership?tab=apiKeys

3. In the o3de_dreamstudio gem, make a files called `.secrets.json`

4. Put your API key in and save file:
   
   1. `"STABILITY_API_KEY": "xx-XXxxxxXXxxXxxxXXXXxXXxXxXxXXxXuxxXxXxxXXxxxXXXXx"`

Notes:

- An example secrets file is: `"o3de_dreamstudio\rename.secrets.json.example"`
- You only get 2 sample image generations, buy membership credits for more
